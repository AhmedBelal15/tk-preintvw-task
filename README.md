# ThinKloud PreInterveiw Task


## About the Task
It was my first time to use angularjs Framework so it was pretty challenging <br>
Started by translating the wireframes to HTML/CSS Code<br>
Then started to add the Logic using Javascript / AngularJS Framework<br>
Finally added a simple nodejs server file to serve the app locally if you want to test it <br>
Simply clone the repo and npm install then npm start xD<br>
