# ThinKloud PreInterveiw Task


## About the Task
It was my first time to use angularjs Framework so it was pretty challenging
Started by translating the wireframes to HTML/CSS Code
Then started to add the Logic using Javascript / AngularJS Framework
Finally added a simple nodejs server file to serve the app locally if you want to test it 
Simply clone the repo and npm install then npm start xD
